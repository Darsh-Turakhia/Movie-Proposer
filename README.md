# Movie-Proposer
A simple random movie proposer in python.

Not able to figure out what to watch. No worry this app got your back just run it. It will travers through the IMDB database and pick up a random movie and display it to you.
You have watched the one it proposed no worry again it asks for your opinion just say y(yes) it will give you another movie it will exit only if you press n(no).

While running for the first time it may take some time to load but from the 2nd iteration onwards it gets quick enough.
